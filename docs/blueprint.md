- Document Upload: Allow users to upload documents for verification.

- Automated Status Update: Automatically update the application status to 'verified' or 'rejected' based on the AI analysis.
- Real-time Dashboard: Display the application's status in real-time, showing whether the document has been successfully verified or flagged for manual review.
